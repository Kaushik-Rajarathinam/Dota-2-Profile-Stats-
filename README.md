# Dota-2-Profile-Stats-
Utilizing DOTABUFF to generate user STATS. (Still working on using OpenDota to create my own data) 

The program utilizes Selenium to read data provided in DOTABUFF.com and grab a user's stats. The program requests a STEAMUSER ID from the user and then inputs it into DOTABUFF, upon which the data is read from and given back to the User.

(This project is to be finished) I will implement it to create a document with complete stats of the profile and little appraisal of what the program will recommend the player to do .
